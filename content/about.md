## Mission Statement

The purpose of this group is to foster community and facilitate connection among technologists and automaters located in the Calgary, Alberta, Canada area. The intent is to encourage contributions and conversations, as well as provide a number of resources to be used as reference in one's own Automation journey. As they say, a rising tide lifts all ships and we're hoping you find some helpful tips, peer dialogue, and guidance in this community and repository.

While we aim to have some corporate structure and support, we're setting up these resources to encourage contributions and the organization of events by anyone in the community. ie, not just vendors or partners. If you have an idea or topic for an event, we'd like you to feel empowered to not just make a suggestion (always welcome) but to also consider running your own event. We'll aim to provide as much guidance and resources here to make this as easy and attainable as we can for anyone interested.

As always, the attendees know best what they would like to hear about. We'd like to hear your ideas and opinions on what should be in the next event!

Please feel free to contact the steering committee with any questions, concerns, comments, ideas, etc.
