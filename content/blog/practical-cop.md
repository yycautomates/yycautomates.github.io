Recently Red Hat hosted a local marketing event headlined by our infamous Chief Strategist, Todd Wilson. It's a topic I've been privileged to hear him speak on many of times and no matter how many times I've heard it - I still really enjoy hearing the message. It's timeless, and simple once you've heard it, but it can be intimidating thinking about where to start.

Todd's prepared an accompanying presentation to this event, and I think it's an excellent resource to help us all understand "How to Build a Community of Practice?". Please see this [PDF resource](http://people.redhat.com/aludwar/2025-05-28-AutomationCoP.pdf).
