Ryan Bontreger is a Lead Consulting Architect in the Automation Practice at Red Hat. He has been delivering automation solutions for the last 10 years, specializing in developer experience and automation at scale.

Ryan's seen it all. He has some excellent guidance on [measuring the success and impact of an automation community of practice](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/measuring-success-and-impact-automation-community-practice). I highly recommend this read, we regularly use this advice when consulting with enterprises on establishing their own communities of practice.
